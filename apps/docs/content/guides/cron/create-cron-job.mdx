title: 'Create a Cron Job'
---

Create a Cron Job from the [Integrations section](/dashboard/project/_/integrations/cron-jobs) section of the Dashboard.

## Create a cron job

1. Go to the [Cron Jobs](/dashboard/project/_/integrations/cron-jobs) tab in the Integrations section.
1. Click `Create a new cron job`.
1. Name your cron job.
1. Give your cron job a schedule.
1. Pick a SQL snippet, function, or HTTP request to execute whenever the cron job runs.
1. Click `Create cron job`.

## Examples

Here are some example use cases for Cron Jobs:

### Delete old data

Create a Cron Job with the following SQL snippet:

```sql
delete from events
  where event_time < now() - interval '1 week';
```

### Run a vacuum

Create a Cron Job with the following SQL snippet:

```sql
vacuum;
```

### Call a stored procedure

To use a stored procedure, create a Cron Job with a SQL snippet to call it:

```sql
call my_procedure();
```

## Caution: Scheduling system maintenance

Be extremely careful when setting up `pg_cron` jobs for system maintenance tasks as they can have unintended consequences. For instance, scheduling a command to terminate idle connections with `pg_terminate_backend(pid)` can disrupt critical background processes like nightly backups. Often, there is an existing Postgres setting e.g. `idle_session_timeout` that can perform these common maintenance tasks without the risk.
